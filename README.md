# Interior design style matcher

This project aims at discovering interior designs that matches the user's tastes.

In order to achieve that, it:
1. Downloads interior design images using google search API's.
2. Allows for image labeling (like/dislike) via a simple UI.
3. Trains a model to identify images that matches the user's preferences.
4. Labels the rest of the images with the trained model.

Each of these steps is contained in a different notebook.
